harnon-cv (Latex Document Class)
----------------------------------

This is a latex document class for building a neat CV document using a 'timeline' for displaying your recent experience.  A minimal working example is provided in sample.tex, which also provides some basic examples of the special commands provided.  

Include the class by starting your .tex file with

    \documentclass{harnon-cv}

You can add your information by writing

	% add your user information
	\author{My Name}
	\youremail{your@email.com}
	\yourwebsite{http://github.com}
	\youraddress{121 Your Address, \\Your Town\\Your Postcode}


You can add headers to document sections as follows

	\adddocumentheader{Top of Page Super heading}
	\addheadertext{Section Heading}
	\addsubheader{Sub section heading}
	\addcallout{Some emphasised text, similar to sub section}

You can also add a timeline as follows

	\starttimeline
		\timelineitem{2009}{Did some stuff}
		\timelinespacer
		\timelineitem{2010}{
			\addtimelinebullet{Some text in a bullet pt}
			\addtimelinebullet{Some more text in a bullet point}
		}
	\stoptimeline

The \timelineseparator command just adds some white space between timeline items. It is optional.
